### **What are the best practices to configure AWS VPC CNI plugin so that the IP addresses are used efficiently.**

### **Short description**

The Amazon VPC Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin for Kubernetes is deployed to each of your Amazon EKS EC2 worker nodes in a Daemonset with the name 'aws-node'. The plugin consists of two primary components: 
- **L-IPAMD**: Responsible for creating network interfaces and attaching the network interfaces to Amazon EC2 instances, assigning secondary IP addresses to network interfaces, and maintaining a warm pool of IP addresses. 
- **CNI plugin:** â€“ Responsible for wiring the host network (for example, configuring the network interfaces and virtual Ethernet pairs) and adding the correct network interface to the pod namespace.

For our topic today lets focus on ***L-IPAMD***, a.k.a Local IP Address Manager Daemon.

### **What exactly does L-IPAMD do?**
- The CNI binary is invoked by the kubelet when a new pod gets scheduled or an existing pod is removed from the node.
- The CNI binary then calls I-PAMD, asking for an IP for the new pod. If there are no available IPs in the cache, it will return an error.
- I-PAMD keeps track of all ENIs and IPs attached to the instance.
- When the number of pods running on the node exceeds the number of addresses that can be assigned to a single network interface, L-IPAMD starts allocating a new network interface, as long as the maximum number of network interfaces for the instance aren't already attached. 

    **Note**: For more information about how many network interfaces and private IP addresses are supported for each network interface, please refer to documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#AvailableIpPerENI).

- There are configuration variables that allow you to change the default behavior for when the plugin creates new network interfaces or attaches additional secondary private IPv4 addresses and they are namely *WARM_ENI_TARGET*, *WARM_IP_TARGET* and *MINIMUM_IP_TARGET*.
- The number of IPs to keep around in the warm pool controlled by WARM_ENI_TARGET, WARM_IP_TARGET and MINIMUM_IP_TARGET

#### **WARM_ENI_TARGET:** 
-  This variable dictates how many ENIs the L-IPAMD should keep available in its warm pool, so that the pods when scheduled on that node can immediately get an IP assigned to it.
   
    **Example:** For a t3.medium type instance, the maximum number of network interfaces that can be attached is '3' and each interface can have about '6' private IPv4 addresses assigned to it. So a total of 18 IPs can be allocated for a given EC2 instance. 
    
    **Note:** Out of the 18 IPs, one IP is assigned to the Primary network interface of the node and the remaining '17' IPs are available to be assigned to kubernetes pods.

- For instance when you set WARM_ENI_TARGET=1, it essentially means that there will always be an additional network interface along with its IPs (count 6) be attached to the node as long as the maximum number of network interfaces for the instance aren't already attached. Therefore a total of 6 IPs (for a t3.medium type instance) are always made available in the I-PAMD's warm pool.
- Even if '1' out of '6' IPs from the ENI gets assigned to a pod, L-IPAMD attaches a new ENI to the node to satisfy the condition of making a full ENIs' IPs available in the warm pool.

#### **WARM_IP_TARGET:** 
- Setting this variable ensures that you always have the defined number of IPs available in the L-IPAMD's warm pool.
- For instance, setting WARM_IP_TARGET=5 indicates that there will always be '5' IP addresses available in the warm pool to assign to the pods immediately as soon as they get scheduled on that node.
- For the same instance type (t3.medium) discussed above which has '3' pods running on it, assuming WARM_ENI_TARGET is not set, to satisfy the '5' available IPs in warm pool condition, L-IPAMD attaches one more ENI to the node and assigns 2 IPv4 addresses to it.

#### **MINIMUM_IP_TARGET:**
- Setting this variable ensures that a minimum of defined number of IPs are assigned to the node when it comes up initially. This value also includes the *WARM_IP_TARGET* value if configured. It is generally used in conjunction with WARM_IP_TARGET.
- For instance setting a MINIMUM_IP_TARGET=4 indicates that, when the node comes up for the first time it should have 4 IPs assigned to its ENI by default, even when there are no pods running on the node.
- If a WARM_IP_TARGET=1 is set along with the MINIMUM_IP_TARGET=4, with no pods running on the node, still a warm pool of 4 IPs is maintained by L-IPAMD as MINIMUM_IP_TARGET also takes into account the value set by WARM_IP_TARGET. So at this point you have a total of 5 IPv4 addresses assigned to the ENI.
- Now, if you provision 5 pods on the above discussed node, the L-IPAMD tries to assign one more IPv4 address to the ENI to satisfy the WARM_IP_TARGET of '1'.
- The MINIMUM_IP_TARGET comes into picture only during the initial stages of a node when it comes up for the first time. Once the MINIMUM_IP_TARGET number of pods are provisioned, L-IPAMD only tries to satisfy WARM_IP_TARGET condition.
